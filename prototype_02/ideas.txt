Walls, moving walls?

different types of bullets
	ones that you need to avoid
		ones that detract score
		ones that break the wall
	bigger bullets with more points
	bullets that move in different patterns
	bullets with power ups
		such as making walls bigger
		making it so there are no gaps for x time
		make walls faster
		show you the path that bullets will take
	
Instead of randomly generated make patterns
	similar to bullet hell style games except in every direction
	patterns will make your wall positions seems more important
	
Add 2 player support for those who cannot handle multitasking 4 walls

Lots of possible ways to improve it
